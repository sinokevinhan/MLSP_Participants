### System Description

The proposed Complex Word Identification (CWI) model comprises three integral modules: the Feature Collection Module, Feature Fusion Module, and Regression Model. The Feature Collection Module is designed to gather diverse feature sets including 16 commonly utilized handcrafted features, GloVe embeddings, and dynamic dependency embeddings. Moreover, this module incorporates Gaussian vectorization techniques to vectorize the handcrafted features effectively. Subsequently, the Feature Fusion Module combines the aforementioned feature types into a cohesive vector representation, which is then passed to the Regression Model. The Regression Model is composed of three layers: two Support Vector Regression (SVR) polynomial layers for feature refinement within the feature vectors, and one feedforward layer aimed at predicting the final complexity value. This comprehensive architecture underscores the model's robustness and efficacy in CWI tasks.
